        <h1>Inventory Managament System</h1><br>
        <span>Source Code : <strong>Privado</strong></span>
        <br><br>

        <p>
            Armazem Para√≠ba, as well as others retail companies, due to its size and size, 
            has an Inventory Management system, which is continually being improved with new 
            algorithms and business rules in order to maximize costs such as holding cost, 
            transportation cost, shortage cost among others.
        </p>
        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>
            This time i integrate in the project by a creation of an API REST, Able to send 
            the sales forecast of one or more products, along with a suggestion of moving the 
            product over a time window, in order to satisfy that demand and minimize costs.
        </p>

        <h2>PreProcessing</h2>
        <hr>

        </p>
            This was a very challenging part of my contributions to the project, due to some issues 
            with the base, like fact that only recently a database was implemented in this system,
            until a few months ago these records were made only by hand, so I had to deal with some 
            normalization differences in the data over time, and deal with a range of human errors.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Pipeline</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>
            To ensure that the problems encountered in preprocessing not happen again, I also 
            create a data pipeline to ensure a better environment for future data scientists 
            manipulating these databases.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Sales Problem</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>
            With the environment ready, I managed a series of methods looking for one that best fit 
            that sales problem for the data available to me. Among the machine learning methods used, 
            the ones that obtained the best results for this problem were XGBoost
            and Arima.<br>
            After Sales forecasting, we calculate a moving suggestion, from the analysis of the 
            company's business rules and the use of optimization algorithms.
        </p>

        <h2>API REST</h2>
        <hr>
            
        <p>
            For Inventory Management system take these predictions and suggestions, I create an
            simple API REST, by microframework Flask, with just a few endpoints,
            to get the data to Sales Problem and post sales updates that go on over time.
